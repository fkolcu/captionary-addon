The extension currently works only on Netflix. Support for other platforms may be added in the future.

### üìö Dictionary Lookup

When you click a word in the subtitle, Captionary uses the Free Dictionary API to retrieve word definitions.
Captionary is not responsible for the Free Dictionary API‚Äôs privacy practices. By using the addon, you also agree to
their terms.
Only the clicked word is sent to the API ‚Äî no other data is sent.
To reduce repeated API calls, word lookups are cached locally in your browser. If a cached version is available, the API
is not contacted again.

Words you look up are automatically saved to your local browser storage.
You can remove any word from the history or clear all history at once from the extension's interface.
